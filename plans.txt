PLANS

Implement tasks / puzzles
Implement text
Implement scoring
Add sub-quests?

What don't I know how to do -

barriers based on held objects

https://adventuron.io/documentation/#QuickStartBarriers

combine / attach objects

timed / turn-based events
- like drowing (or being forced to surface)

maybe - townsman who follows you

maybe - goto location if not already been there

: goto "";

still like idea of elf having to disguise self - like to get into place

change some system messages

graphics

walkthrough text & video

is_present
is_treasure
is_locked
is_blocking

---

LOCATION BASED COMMANDS -

locations {
   bottom_of_hill : location "You are standing at the bottom of the hill." {

      on_command {
         // Local command handlers here
      }

can get rid of checking if present
