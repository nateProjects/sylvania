PLANS

TO DO

X Change Pig Pen to Blacksmith - change directions - remove pig pen n/s to butcher
Add seaperson (if boat fixed) - put shell there for now
Add barriers to town (no hat = no enter)
Add Townsman in exile (or temp. get hat at location) - add hat to clearing
Add Boar puzzle
Add diving conditions

Note: like idea of merman saying to you you have to show you are ready to defeat creature first before getting special shell

Could use lantern / torch with mole people instead of horn for sound?
Maybe need to get blacksmith to fashion hook - from what, in return for what?
Take out marble sphere?
Point out it isn't a real egg in giant eagle nest

examine

: if_examine "red_fish" {
   : print "IT STINKS!" ;
}

What don't I know how to do -

barriers based on held objects

https://adventuron.io/documentation/#QuickStartBarriers
block_when_not

combine / attach objects

timed / turn-based events
- like drowing (or being forced to surface)

what about "ask x about y"

maybe - townsman who follows you

maybe - goto location if not already been there

: goto "";

still like idea of elf having to disguise self - like to get into place

change some system messages

graphics

loading_screen = excalibur_loading

walkthrough text & video

is_present
is_treasure
is_locked
is_blocking

---

LOCATION BASED COMMANDS -

locations {
   bottom_of_hill : location "You are standing at the bottom of the hill." {

      on_command {
         // Local command handlers here
      }

can get rid of checking if present

---

Scoring

Point for each object
Points for each place
Points for each task (x10?)
Points of each jewel (x30?)

---

When done at least release web & ZX Spectrum version

Could use Adventuron (PAW/DAAD) or Inform -
