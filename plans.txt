examine

: if_examine "red_fish" {
   : print "IT STINKS!" ;
}

What don't I know how to do -

barriers based on held objects

https://adventuron.io/documentation/#QuickStartBarriers
block_when_not

combine / attach objects

timed / turn-based events
- like drowing (or being forced to surface)

what about "ask x about y"

maybe - townsman who follows you

maybe - goto location if not already been there

: goto "";

still like idea of elf having to disguise self - like to get into place

change some system messages

graphics

loading_screen = excalibur_loading

LOCATION BASED COMMANDS -

locations {
   bottom_of_hill : location "You are standing at the bottom of the hill." {

      on_command {
         // Local command handlers here
      }

can get rid of checking if present
