if boat hasn't been fixed description is -

There is an old fisherman here lamenting the hole in the side of his small boat (which he has brought into his home).

if boat has been fixed -
(if boat object is not there?)

The fisherman is gone, perhaps to go fishing.

is it hull that he is fixing?

TO DO

add - goto / go - if have visted place before

need to account for - 
  : if (is_carried "axe") {
    if he is not there - is_present

is a man a non-takeable object?

Need to force player back to surface if tries to dive without shell -
maybe just auto message (keep in boat)

Change Butcher & Pig Pen?
To Keep?
Or could trade Butcher for Spear

Take out reed - will have shell instead

Where does horn come from?

Should the player chop the wood down?

Need to add something if verb can't be used in place
    such as talking to someone who isn't there
