TAKE SHELL (or given it)
(in church? or ante-chamber? or change butcher to keep)
W,S,S,E

To enter town need to cover elf ears
    Perhaps you need to do this to get in town at all
Meet exiled human - he will help you if you help him - gives hat
He was one tending to boar when it was stolen
He is in good favour if you return boar & tell story
    (Account for all these different orders and possibilities - 
    such as if get boar independently, maybe butcher mentions)
Maybe he is one who can pick lock / or maybe it's just a two man job
    He gives you hat
    When you have hat you can enter town

TAKE SPEAR (or TRADE BOAR FOR SPEAR) - can't until can enter town
W,N,N,E
ENTER BOAT (E)
DIVE (D)
FIGHT CLAM / PRY CLAM - lose spear after this
    Maybe there is squid and clam
TAKE PEARL & TENTACLE
SURFACE / resurface (U)
LEAVE BOAT (W)

maybe they give you clue to next jewel

Jewel of Sky -

Try to climb mountain - can't quite make it - if only you had something you could throw up a little further that would latch on
Maybe man pays you for fixing boat
This gives you money to get hook from Blacksmith
(if try to spend it at butcher hit brings up quest or says he is sold out - maybe even closes up for the day)
You get rope from boar that was tied up
Attach rope to hook
Climb up mountain / see eagles nest / it attacks if you try to take egg
    - if it doesn't see an egg there it will attack
? Go to church -  Get ceremonial egg - maybe have to distract priest - burn curtain? maybe Paint?
Or use Tentacle / or maybe Snake Skin to scare away Eagle

Can't complete without doing Jewel Of Sea quest?

---

Jewel Of Earth -

Get monk's robe from church & wear it
    What stands in the way of this?
Try to enter - they smell that something isn't right
Roll in mud (or put robe in mud)
Then can enter
    Need to pour water on lava or make bridge over it
    Or damn up stream to divert water
Steal jewel
    is it that easy? Do you have to distract them first? Loud noise?
Need to find another way out - or they take back jewel and throw you out?
    How to open alternative exit
        maybe sound causes rockfall?

Maybe horn makes sound - maybe he is given it at the start, meant to play it when completed quest

---

Human friend - Jewel of Spirit

When he is in good favour he can show you where jewel is
    Pick jewel you are most likely to get nearest to the end
But can't get it unless do X
    Maybe until you show other jewel which chief tries to steal, but friend intervenes - becomes exiled again - but ultimately becomes right hand man in your kingdom

maybe just leave out Jewel of Spirit - just make it three jewels!

Questions -

maybe have to at least deal with boar to get to cave mouth - or boar will stop you

or perhaps boar roams around and you have to catch it
(love idea of trapping it - but adds even more to game)

if boat hasn't been fixed description is -

There is an old fisherman here lamenting the hole in the side of his small boat (which he has brought into his home).

if boat has been fixed -
(if boat object is not there?)

The fisherman is gone, perhaps to go fishing.

is it hull that he is fixing?

TO DO

add - goto / go - if have visted place before

need to account for - 
  : if (is_carried "axe") {
    if he is not there - is_present

is a man a non-takeable object?

Need to force player back to surface if tries to dive without shell -
maybe just auto message (keep in boat)

Change Butcher & Pig Pen?
To Keep?
Or could trade Butcher for Spear

Take out reed - will have shell instead

Where does horn come from?

Should the player chop the wood down?

Need to add something if verb can't be used in place
    such as talking to someone who isn't there
