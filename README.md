### Jewels

* Jewel of the sky - great eagle's nest
* Jewel of the earth - molemen protect
* Jewel of the deep - mermen guard
* Jewel of the spirit? - in castle?

#### To get Jewel of the Deep

* Go to fisherman - He tells you about jewel of sea
* Can't take you to spot without boat fixed
* Have to get wood from forest

* (can be fisherman - may be man in village - if do him favor - need younger man who can outrun guards - maybe old man will try but fail))

* So, If you change clothes with fisherman (& suggest he lead guards away)
* Then can chop wood and bring it back to boat and fix it
* He takes you to spot but you can't dive long enough because you don't have bladder (reed will let you breath for a while - maybe long enough to find out why) 
* To get bladder ... have to get wild boar from Butcher - gross? (but molemen have taken local boars?) 
* To get boars from molemen ... (Perhaps in only above ground part / fenced in / break out without being attacked / camoflage)

* When have boar take to butcher and get bladder
* Take bladder to fisherman who turns it into breathing apparatus
* Visit mermen who tell you you can have jewel if you rescue mermaid (mermaid is being held by octopus) 
* Get spear ... (Maybe get from guard who drops it - or guard at castle, or suit of armor) 
* Spear between eyes (Capture ink for some reason?) 
* Collect pearl - you have the first jewel!

* And get bird away long enough to swap it out - how to scare away?
