Scratchpad

Quick -

add tentacle - do you need to use axe to cut? (too much cutting already! don't let you take axe in sea - will rust it)
    create when stab

give boar to butcher
create spear

Exile

say something about hat & helping him free boar

have him follow to where boar is
    maybe have him there to begin with!

Boar

Need to get exile to distract boar or he won't let you cut rope
    exile should say something about molepeople

can't free unless -
a) have axe
b) exile there - if there to begin with easier

  : match "cut rope" {
    : if (is_at "valley") {
      : if (is_carried "axe") {
        : print   "Stuff here.";

if already used axe on wood

        : destroy "axe";

add boar at the end of a rope to inventory & say something about it

      }
    }
  }
